Recreating the original Zelda mechanics in Unity

Includes a Zelda screen-scrolling system, sword & enemy mechanics, npc dialog systems, signs, keys, chests, and scene transitions for caves, homes, & dungeons.
The demo is a focus on coding rather than art, so all art is placeholder simple geometry.
